            <h1>BRIEF HISTORY OF <br> KONYIL ISRAEL PATRICK</h1>
        <section>
                <h2>Early LIfe </h2>   
                <p>I was given birth to the family of Mr & Mrs PATRICK .Y. KONYIL on the 6th October, 1998. I was born and brought up in Gindiri, Plateau State, Nigeria. As time goes by, I had junior ones being the first born of the family but unfortunately, they all lost their lives. <br>I was left with my Daddy and Mummy. In the year 2006, December, my mum felt sick to the point that she spent her Christmas and New Year in pains. <br> 27th of January, 2007, she went to rest with our Lord Jesus Christ. At this point, I was left with my Daddy, and the darkness seems as though it will never pass away. Thank God for God.<br> Currently, I'm a 300LvL student of the Federal University of Petroleum Resources, Effurun, Warri, Delta State studying Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering. I really love the course am studying which gives me a passion and drive to the Petroleum Industry.</p>
